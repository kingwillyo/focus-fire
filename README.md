🔥 FocusFire
A Productivity App That Ignites Your Focus

FocusFire is a minimalist productivity app designed to help students and creators stay disciplined, avoid distractions, and build long-term focus streaks.
It combines a powerful Pomodoro timer, an app blocker, and a unique barcode unlock system that prevents you from exiting sessions early.

✨ Features
🔥 Focus Streak System

Stay motivated and build momentum with daily focus streaks. Every completed session fuels your “fire”.

⏱️ Pomodoro Timer (Unexitable)

A clean, distraction-proof Pomodoro timer UI that cannot be exited mid-session unless the user scans a generated barcode.

📵 App Blocking

Choose which apps to block during focus sessions. Prevents social media, games, or any app from interrupting your study time.

📸 Barcode Unlock Mechanism

Exiting a session requires scanning a unique barcode — making procrastination harder and focus easier.

🔐 Google Authentication

Simple onboarding with a Google Sign-In button.

🎨 Beautiful UI

Inspired by modern productivity apps.
Includes:

Dark gradient background

Minimalist flame logo

Custom Google button
